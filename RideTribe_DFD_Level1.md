## Data Flow Patterns

### User-Centric Flows
1. **Registration Flow**: Travelers → P1 → D1 → External Services
2. **Trip Participation Flow**: Travelers → P2 → D2 → D1 → P4 → D4
3. **Expense Management Flow**: Travelers → P3 → D3 → D2 → P7 → D6

### Admin-Centric Flows
1. **Moderation Flow**: Administrators → P6 → D7 → D10
2. **User Management Flow**: Administrators → P1 → D1 → D10
3. **Content Review Flow**: P5 → P6 → D5 → D7

### System Integration Flows
1. **External Service Integration**: External Services ↔ P1, P2, P3, P4, P7
2. **Cross-Process Communication**: P1 ↔ P2 ↔ P3 ↔ P4 ↔ P5 ↔ P6 ↔ P7
3. **Data Synchronization**: All Processes ↔ Respective Data Stores

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection
- All data flows are encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- User authentication required for most flows
- Role-based access control for admin flows

### Privacy Controls
- User consent management in P1
- Data retention policies across all processes
- GDPR compliance in data flows
- Anonymization for analytics

### Audit Trails
- All admin actions logged in D10
- User activity tracking across processes
- Data access logging
- Compliance reporting

## Performance Considerations

### Data Flow Optimization
- Efficient database queries and indexing
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for notifications
- Real-time updates for critical flows

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for all processes
- Database sharding strategies
- Load balancing for external service calls
- CDN for static content delivery
